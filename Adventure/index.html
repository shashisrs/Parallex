          people interested in aerial sports, and it allows one to run off the
          slopes with free parachutes. Paragliding is generally more accessible

          or a landing track. Paragliding is also the fastest developed air
          sport in the world.Paragliding is a common recreational sport in high
          mountain ranges. Everything seems to be fine when you are up in the
          sky floating like a bird amidst the cool breeze or freezing snow. The
          riders fly up on a free flying lightweight paraglider with high safety
          measures. It allows you to capture the breath taking views of the city
          covered either with snow or greenery.Paragliding gives you an
          opportunity to fly into the air breaking all odds. A little training
          about how to control your movement in air and you are all set to fly.
          It is pertinent here to mention that the longest straight distance
          covered ever by Para gliding is 502.9 km.

          the water sport is a challenge that you play with the daredevil waves.
          The surfer rides on a board freely forward facing the loud waves,
          which carries the surfer to the shore. Today, surfing is one of the
          most popular and most preferred extreme sports in the world. It is
          done by riding the waves in the sea or the ocean by standing or lying
          on a surfboard. This extreme sport, which is thought to have
          originated in the Southern Hemisphere in ancient times, was a
          necessity rather than entertainment or a hobby. Used as a way to
          return to the shore from the ships originally, surfing became a hobby
          with time and an official sport in 1920. Before going for a
          challenging surf ride, make sure you are mentally and physically
          prepared to face the wave. Because waves are loud and deep, but you
          have to enjoy the ride!
